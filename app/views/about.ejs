        <h1>How did I make this website?</h1>
        <p>
            This website is served to you by a <a class="text-white" href="https://nodejs.org/">node.js</a> app running
            in a <a class = "text-white" href="https://www.docker.com/">Docker</a> container on an
            <a class="text-white" href="https://aws.amazon.com/">AWS</a> instance.
        </p>
        <p>
            All of the AWS infrastructure has been provisioned using <a class="text-white" href="https://www.terraform.io/">Terraform</a>,
            and all of the instances have been configured using <a class="text-white" href="https://www.ansible.com/">Ansible</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
            The domain was registered at <a class="text-white" href="#">idkyet</a>, and the certificate has been
            acquired from <a class="text-white" href="https://letsencrypt.org/">Let's Encrypt</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
            Of course, the website isn't set in stone, I'll add and remove stuff from it in the future (made easy by
            <a class="text-white", href="https://github.com/features/actions">GitHub actions</a>). All of the relevant code
            and version history can be found <a class="text-white" href="https://github.com/dominik-matic/my-website">here</a>.
        </p>
